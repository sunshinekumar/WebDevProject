					<p>Weddings are such a joyous occasion and each one is different! The same is true of our wedding cakes. We have an almost unlimited combination of flavors and styles to choose from. </p>

					<ul>

						<li>Batters and fillings:
						Our most popular batter is yellow, but we also offer red velvet, chocolate, marble, and others upon request. As for fillings, we recommend white buttercream icing, chocolate fudge icing, strawberry crème filling, vanilla pastry cream, or one of several fruit fillings (lemon, raspberry, apricot, strawberry, etc.). That being said, if you have something special in mind it can’t hurt to ask!</li>

						<li>Sizes:
						To keep proportionality and maintain structure, wedding cakes come in certain sizes with certain tier dimensions. If the size of the wedding party falls in between cake sizes, we can offer additional sheet cakes up to the amount of slices required.</li>

						<li>Pricing:
						Our wedding cakes vary in price, depending on type, size, and “extras” such as special fillings, pillars, etc. For example, the cakes seen above are in the $3.25 – $3.75 per serving range.</li>

						<li>Other delicacies:
						Our wedding cakes are really just the beginning. Lots of folks opt for Individual desserts (3” mini-cakes, cupcakes, etc.) and of course there’s always room in the celebration for Cookie Trays, Monogrammed Petit Fours, Junior Pastry Trays, Grooms’ Cakes, Shower Cakes, Monogrammed Cookies, Wedding Challah, Breakfast Trays, etc.</li>

						<li>Delivery:
						We co-ordinate with the reception venue, florist, etc. for the timing of the delivery of the cake. Delivery fees vary by location. Smaller cakes can be packed by us to facilitate pick-up at the bakery.</li>

			<h4>About us:</h4>
				<div><p>Prantl’s Bakery is a Pittsburgh institution. Its “Burnt Almond Torte” and 100+ sinful sweets have been a tradition for the last 40 years. In fact, there’s been a bakery in continuous operation at the flagship Shadyside store for over 100 years. Prantl’s is a bakery in the German tradition, with old-fashioned fruit Danish and nut-filled coffeecakes, but we can’t help but get excited about some of our “new favorites” as well, like key lime pie and our buttery croissants. In addition to our mouth watering special order cakes, we are famous for our “Burnt Almond Torte”, which was conceived by Henry Prantl after a trip to California. There was an almond glut the year he went and the Almond Board was trying to get bakers to use almonds in new and inspiring ways. Henry picked up a few ideas and brought them back to Pittsburgh where he refined them into our current recipe for “Burnt Almond Torte”, a unique and addictive dessert.
				Henry and Jane Prantl retired from the business in 2007. The bakery is now owned and operated by John M. Felice, who strives to maintain the tradition of high quality baked goods.</p></div>
